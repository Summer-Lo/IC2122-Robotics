# IC2122-Robotics Lab
IC2122 Robotics Lab is developed aiming to enable students to learn about the basic concept of robot arm. Combining with some exercises to practice their controlling skill.

# 1.TASKS

## 1. Forward kinematics
Clicking the button of the control panel or pressing the keyboard to control these joint angles to achieve forward kinematics. 

### 1a. Forward Kinematics praticing
Move the end-effector to the RED block using Forward Kinematics and write down the joint angles.

### 1b. Forward Kinematics praticing
Move the end-effector to the YELLOW block using Forward Kinematics and write down the joint angles. 

### 1c. Pick and Place (Forward Kinematics)
Place the BLUE block on the table (inside Blue colour area) using Forward Kinematics and write down the procedure. 
 
## 2. Inverse kinematics
Clicking the button of the control panel and input the target position and orientation to achieve inverse kinematics. 

### 2a. Inverse Kinematics praticing
Move the end-effector to the RED block using Inverse Kinematics and write down the procedure. 

### 2b. Pick and place (Inverse Kinematics)
Pick the BLUE block and place it on the table using Inverse Kinematics and write down the procedure.

### 2c. Inverse Kinematics (Multiple solution demo)
Move the end-effector to the BLUE block using Inverse Kinematics often provides different solutions or approaches. 
 
## 3. Pick and Place
Assume there is a collaborative robot working in the factory. These color blocks are the materials that are required to process. (Remark: Without any collision with other objects)

### 3a. Pick and Place for processing materials
Pick the RED block and Place it on the table using Inverse Kinematics for processing and write down the procedure. (Return to the home position at the final step)

### 3b. Pick and Place for completing process
Pick the RED block and Place it on the original position using Inverse Kinematics and write down the procedure. (Return to the home position at the final step)

### 3c. Python Code control
Modify the program and click “Clicking this button for completing whole task automatically” button to complete the whole process automatically. Write down the procedure and explain your program

## 4. Homogeneous Transformation
Pratice the knowledge and concept of Homogeneous Transformation which can be used to solve the corrdinate issue of rotated and translated object.

### 4a. Homogeneous Transformation praticing
Calculate the translated & rotated value and translation & rotation axis, and Homogeneous Transformation matrix using Homogeneous Transformation

### 4b. Homogeneous Transformation for collaborative robots
Calculate the following results using Homogeneous Transformation
1. Translated & rotated value and translation & rotation axis
2. Homogeneous Transformation matrix 
3. WHITE Block position (x, y, z) based on translated and rotated UR3 (UR3B) coordinate

### 4c. Homogeneous Transformation for collaborative robots
Calculate the following results using Homogeneous Transformation
1. Translated & rotated value and translation & rotation axis
2. Homogeneous Transformation matrix 
3. YELLOW Block position (x, y, z) based on translated and rotated UR3 (UR3B) coordinate
